##General Report Navigation

The following section contains a brief review of several of the most helpful report navigation tips used with the Caregiver's Checklist. These include creating bookmarks and mailing bookmarks as links.

**Creating Bookmarks:** Once the report is filtered and the desired data is displayed, a bookmark can be created to return to this list at any desired time. To create a bookmark, click on the Star icon with the plus (+) sign located on the menu at the top of the application (as illustrated in the screen shot below).

![Navigation Figure 1](_images/Navigation_Fig_1.png "Navigation Figure 1")\

Once clicked, the following dialog box is displayed. The default name contains the current date and a number indicating the number of the bookmark created that day. Since this default name isn’t intuitive, a new name should be given to the bookmark that describes what it represents. In the example below, the name “Sample Bookmark” is given.

If desired, a short description can also be included in the bookmark definition. The default checkbox selections can be left as they are. Once a new name and description, if desired, is entered click the OK button. This newly added bookmark displays in the “Select Bookmark” drop-down box (illustrated below).

![Navigation Figure 3](_images/Navigation_Fig_3.png "Navigation Figure 3")\

As many bookmarks as needed can be created and are saved with the report.

If a bookmark is no longer needed, the Star icon with the minus (-) sign can be clicked and a list of the current bookmarks is displayed. Select the bookmark to remove from the drop-down box then click Remove to remove that bookmark.

**Mailing Bookmarks as Links:** In addition to creating bookmarks for your personal use, filter selections can also be shared with other licensed users via email. To do this, move your cursor over the More option at the end of the menu above the application. This will drop down a list of options, one of which is Mail with Bookmark as a Link (illustrated below).


![Navigation Figure 4](_images/Navigation_Fig_4.png "Navigation Figure 4")\

Clicking this option launches your email software and automatically enters a link in both the subject line of the email and the body of the email. Either one of the links can be removed, if desired, and additional information can be included in the email to provide the recipient with information on what they are receiving. Recipients must have the proper credentials to access the reports using a link.


##The Physician Scorecard

###Selecting a Physician

When opening the Physician Scorecard, you will be presented with a list of physicians, along with some relevant metrics. To find a specific physician, you can narrow down the results by selecting the first letter of the physicians last name from the options provided to the left of the list of physicians.  This will narrow the list to aid in finding the desired physician.  Additionaly, it is possible to search for a physician from the search bar above the list by name, Tax Identification Number (TIN), or National Provider Identifier (NPI).

Once a specific physician is selected from the list, or the search bar, you will be taken to the scorecard for that physician.

###Selecting a Metric

In addition to finding specific physicians through a method listed in the previous section, it is also possible to find physicians by their score on a number of different metrics.  To select a metric to make a comparison, you should click on the drop down menu above the physician list labeled "Metric".  Once you have clicked on the arrow, you will be presented with a list of measures to choose from.  Once you select the desired metric, you will notice the physician list has been updated to reflect your selection.  At this point, you can then sort the list by the metric by double clicking on the column header to view the highest, and lowest, performing physicians by the selected measure.
